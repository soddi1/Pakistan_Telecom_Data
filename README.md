Queries that our project should be able to answer:

1. Which provider is best in x city for y service? (3G, 4G throughput, call completion ratio, speech quality etc.)
2. Which data / off net calls/ on net calls/ application specific data package is the cheapest for x service provider?
3. Which service provider has the cheapest data / off net calls/ on net calls/ application specific data package?
4. Which telecom providers improved their services from year x to year y?
5. Which services were improved upon by telecom provider x from year 1 to year 2?
6. What are the latest offers for data and call packages by x operator that I can benefit from given my usage patterns or location of usage?
7. Which city has the worst/best value of x kpi?
8. How has the cost/service ratio progressed over the years for x telecom provider? (Analyze the historical trend of the cost of data and
call packages relative to network performance (signal strength, data throughput, call drop rates))
9. Which regions in the country obtain the best performance/cost ratio?
10. Which telecom provider performs reasonably well across all regions?

How to Check Data Usage on a Device:

For Android:
Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down to the desired application. We see data usage by mobile data after selecting that application from the list.

For iOS:
Go to Settings > Mobile Service. We can see data usage for all the applications.
We can see total mobile data used as well.
